## Getting started
Add a new device for your charging point. The app uses your Homeys location to find the nearest charging points. For now this is in a fixed 1km square around Homeys location.

## Usage
* In the flow editor use the triggers to start a flow when someone starts/stops charging or when there are free connectors.
* Use the "Free" connectors tag to check the number of free connectors.

## Supported devices
* All charging points on https://my.thenewmotion.com. Special icons for:
    * The New Motion LoLo
    * ICU EVE with two connectors
    * EV-Box
