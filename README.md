# The New Motion

Adds support for EV charging points.

## What's new?
* Everything; this is the initial release!

## Getting started
Add a new device for your charging point. The app uses your Homeys location to find the nearest charging points. For now this is in a fixed 1km square around Homeys location.

## Usage
* In the flow editor, a UniFi Camera action card can be used to create a snapshot, which is is saved to an Image tag.
* A flow can also be triggered when a snapshot is created using the UniFi Video application card. This card supplies the name of the camera that created the snapshot and the snapshot image itself.

## Supported devices
* All charging points on https://my.thenewmotion.com. Special icons for:
    * The New Motion LoLo
    * EV-Box
